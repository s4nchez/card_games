# basic operations

* create group of cards
    - private group: "owner" sees one side of the cards, others see the other side
* flipping card(s)
* shuffle group
* rotate cards
* action privileges?
* reset? (get all cards and put back in deck)

## done

* create group of cards
    - group types:
          * stack
          * normal (side-by-side)
          * overlapped
* add card(s) to group
* move group position
* move card(s) to another group
* move card(s) inside group

* deck is a predefined (hidden)stack
* game starts with all the cards available
* player can join game in progress
* player view points/ orientation?

New API (v 1.1):

Assumptions:
* target group defines the state of the moved card
* every change to a group the server sends a new id
* commands with the wrong group id are refused

create group  -> (source group id, source card idx, new position)
          all <- (actor, source group old id, source group new id, target group new id, card image*)

move card  -> (source group id, source card idx, target group id, target card idx)
      all <- (actor, source group old id, source group new id, source card idx, target group old id, target group new id, target group card idx**, card image*)

reposition group -> (source group id, new position)
            all  <- (actor, source group old id, source group new id, new position)

restyle group -> (source group id, new style)
         all  <- (actor, source group old id, source group new id, new style)

shuffle group -> (group id)
         all  <- (actor, source group old id, source group new id, [card image, ...]*)

set ownership  -> (source group id, owner***)
          all <- (actor, source group old id, source group new id, owner, [card image, ...]*)

* if (target) group has owner, only visible to him. The rest will receive a generic "back of the card" image.
** if target group has owner, only visible to him.
*** a player, no one or everyone.

Examples:
* hidden deck = create group, no owner
* dealing card = create group (source deck) + set owner to player + move more cards
* discard (visible) = create group (from player owned group) + set owner to public
* discard (hidden) = create group (from player owned group) + set owner to no one

Open questions:
* do stacks have special properties i.e. can only push and pop from the top
